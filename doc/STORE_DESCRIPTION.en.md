NextTab is a new tab extension focused on boosting your browsing efficiency. We want to provide you with a clean, modern, and truly useful start page, allowing you to find your targets faster and focus on what really matters every time you open a new tab.

Why should you install NextTab?
During daily browsing, we often find ourselves digging through cluttered bookmarks, history, and open tabs to find what we need.

It runs entirely locally and collects zero privacy data.
